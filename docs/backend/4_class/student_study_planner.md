## Main Methods

### Init
Initializes a student’s personalized study planner from a master planner and their academic history.
```JS
Init(student_id, planner_id)
```
#### Parameters
| Name       | Type     | Description                                     |
| ---------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| student_id | `string` | The student’s unique identifier.                |
| planner_id | `number` | The master study planner ID to initialize from. |
#### Description
- Initializes the **master study planner** by fetching all required unit and course data.
- Verifies that the master study planner is complete before proceeding.
- Fetches **student information** and **unit history**.
- Processes all units into completed and uncompleted sets.
- Groups completed units by year and term, then inserts them into the planner structure.
- Dynamically places uncompleted units into years based on the current date and previous failures.
- Applies amendments from the database (`StudentStudyPlannerAmmendmentsDB`).
- Populates the study planner with course details (course, major, intake).
- Cleans and finalizes the study planner for use.
#### Returns
| Type                | Description                                                       |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| StudentStudyPlanner | The fully initialized and updated student study planner instance. |

```JS
ProcessUnits(all_units, unit_history)
```
#### Parameters
| Name         | Type    | Description                                            |

#### Description
- Initializes `completed_units` as empty and copies all units into `uncompleted_units`. 
- Sorts the student’s unit history chronologically (by **Year**, then **Term Year**, then **Term Month**).
- Performs a batch fetch of unit details for all history unit codes to optimize lookups.
- Iterates through each historical unit record and:
    1. **Case 1: Found in master planner**
        - Adds the unit to `completed_units` with term, year, and status.
        - Removes it from `uncompleted_units` if status is `"pass"`.
    2. **Case 2: MPU unit**
        - Creates a completed MPU unit with default credit points and marks it as completed.
    3. **Case 3: Not in master planner, but can replace an elective**
        - If the student passed, replaces an elective slot with this unit.
        - Populates details from batch fetch results if available, otherwise falls back to history data.
        - Removes the elective from `uncompleted_units` if passed.
    4. **Case 4: Not in master planner and no elective available**
        - Creates a completed “External” unit with elective-like type metadata.
        - Keeps `uncompleted_units` unchanged.
#### Returns
none

| sem_index       | `number`        | The semester index of the unit.                       |
| unit_index      | `number`        | The index of the unit within the semester.            |
| req             | `Object`        | The minimum credit point requirement to be satisfied. |
| completed_codes | `string[]`      | List of completed unit codes.                         |
| units_offered   | `Array<Object>` | List of all units offered by term.                    |

#### Description

- Scans later semesters for potential swap candidates.
- Prioritizes swapping with **elective units** before other types.
- Uses `EvaluateMinCP` to check if the swap satisfies the minimum CP requirement.
- If a valid swap is found:
    - Updates the planner with the swapped units.
    - Records amendments for both units.
- Returns `false` if no valid swap is possible.

#### Returns
| Type      | Description                                                                   |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `boolean` | `true` if a swap successfully resolves the minCP conflict, otherwise `false`. |

### GetAllPassedAndPlannedUnitsRatioByUnitType

Generates a summary of unit types in the planner, showing counts and ratios of **passed** and **planned** units.

```JS
GetAllPassedAndPlannedUnitsRatioByUnitType()
```
#### Parameters
_None_
#### Description
- Iterates through all units in the planner. 
- Groups units by their **unit type**.    
- Counts the number of:
    - `passed` units.
    - `planned` units (including units with no status).
    - `total` units.
- Calculates ratio `passedAndPlanned / total`.
- Includes the **unit type color** if available.
#### Returns

| Type     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Object` | An object keyed by unit type name, where each value contains:  <br>- `passed`: number of passed units  <br>- `planned`: number of planned units  <br>- `passedAndPlanned`: combined total  <br>- `total`: total number of units  <br>- `ratio`: formatted string `"X/Y"`  <br>- `color`: hex color code for the type. |
