### API (Application Programming Interface)

Documents the secure communication layer, covering the API design style (e.g., RESTful) and comprehensive documentation for all operational endpoints.

### Class Structure

Defines the core logical components, outlining the main classes, their responsibilities, and how they implement the application's business logic using OOP principles.

### Testing

Describes our quality assurance strategy, detailing the implementation of various tests (unit, integration, end-to-end) and guidelines for maintaining high test coverage.

### Deployment

Covers how the backend service is deployed in production, including the hosting environment, configuration variables, and the CI/CD pipeline used for automated delivery.
