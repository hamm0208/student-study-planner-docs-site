# UAT Session

The UAT focused on assessing both the functional performance and user experience of the system to ensure readiness for deployment. Participants were observed not only on the completion of assigned tasks but also on how intuitively they interacted with the system. While specific test scenarios were provided, all users were naturally inclined to explore the system independently, demonstrating engagement. The testing covered the following areas:

## System & General Functions

- Verification of user authentication, session handling, and dashboard responsiveness.
- Review of audit logs, error handling, and system performance.

## Study Planner Management

- Testing of planner import, conflict resolution, and editing features for HODs and course coordinators.

## Role-Based Access & User Management

- Validation of Super Admin capabilities to create, assign, and update user roles and permissions.
- Assessment of role-based dashboards, access restrictions, and account management functions (activation, deactivation, reset).

## Student Access & Interaction

- Testing of personalized study planner viewing, update notifications, and cross-device accessibility.
- Verification of data accuracy and completeness from the student perspective.

## User Experience (UX) Evaluation

- Observation of how easily users could navigate and perform tasks without guidance.
- Evaluation of system intuitiveness, layout clarity, and responsiveness to user actions.

## Participants & Feedbacks

Participants are assigned their own user role to be used for testing the different workflows. The roles are assigned based on their background.
