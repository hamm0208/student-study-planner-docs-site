# Unit Type

## Overview
Unit Types are categories that classify units for timetable display (e.g., Lecture, Tutorial, Lab). Each unit type has a custom color for visual distinction. You can add, edit, and manage unit types, and optionally protect certain types from accidental modifications.

## Add (Create) Unit Type

:::note
When adding a unit type, you can customize its color manually. This color will be used to identify the unit type in timetables.

## Edit (Update) Unit Type

:::note
Protected unit types (marked with a "Protected" label) can only have their color changed—their name cannot be edited. Unprotected unit types can have both name and color modified.

## Manage Protection (System Protected)

:::note
This feature allows you to protect certain unit types from accidental modification. Protected unit types cannot have their name edited or be deleted—only their color can be changed. You can add or remove the "Protected" label as needed.
